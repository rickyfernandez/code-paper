{\bf ThirdOrderA} 

This interpolation method provides third-order accuracy based on the
Triangular Shaped Cloud (TSC) methodology \citep{Hockney88}.  As
%usual, in one dimension, we define the parent values as $Q_{-1}$,
%$Q_0$, and $Q_{+1}$, where the central parent cell has a left edge at
%$x_0$ and width $\Delta x$.  Then, the interpolated value for a
%subgrid cell $q_i$ with a cell left edges at $x_i = x_0 + i \Delta
%x^p/r$ where $i$ runs from 0 to $r-1$ for refinement factor $r$, is
%given by:
