\subsection{Physical Equations}
The spatial and temporal evolution of a compressible fluid is governed by the Euler equations.
The Euler equations are a set of hyperbolic conservation laws governing the density $\rho$,
velocity $\mathbf{v}$, and total specific energy $E$ (specific kinetic energy
$\frac{1}{2}\rho \mathbf{v}^2$ plus specific internal energy $u$). These quantities $\mathbf{U}$
and their respected fluxes $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{U})$, defined through the Euler equations, are
conviently expressed in vector form as
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{U} =
    \left(
    \begin{array}{c}
        \rho \\
        \mathbf{v} \\
        \rho e \\
    \end{array} \right),
    \quad
    \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{U}) =
    \left(
    \begin{array}{c}
        \rho\mathbf{v} \\
        \rho\mathbf{v}\mathbf{v}^T + P \\
        \rho e\mathbf{v} + P\mathbf{v} \\
    \end{array}
    \right),
\end{equation}
%
where P is the pressure. In this notation the Euler equations can be expressed in the form
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq.euler}
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{U}}{\partial t} + \div \mathbf{F} = 0.
\end{equation}
%
As currently stated the system of equations are not closed; more variables then equations. Thus,
a constraint is needed and is supplied by the equation of state
%
\begin{equation}
    P = \rho(\gamma - 1)u,
\end{equation}
%
where $\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats.

These equations can be solved by the finite-volume approach, which is a discretization
of the domain into finite sized disjoint cells and evolves their spatial averaged
$\mathbf{U}$ values. Specifically, applying eq.\ref{eq.euler} to every cell $i$ with
volume $V_i$ and performing Gauss' theorem to convert the volume integral to a
surface integral results in
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq.euler_int}
    \frac{d\mathbf{Q}_i}{dt} =
    -\sum_{j}\int\mathbf{F}_{ij}(\mathbf{U})\cdot\mathbf{A}_{ij},
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{Q}_i$ is the volume integral of $\mathbf{U}_i$ and $\mathbf{A}_{ij}$ is the
cell's surface area normal. Here, an assumption is taken that the cells volume is a polyhedron
such that the surface integral can become a sum over all polygon faces. Furthermore, time
is discretize leading to an update of the cells quanitites
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq.flux_update}
    \mathbf{Q}_i^{n+1} = \mathbf{Q}_i^n - \Delta t\sum_j \mathbf{\hat{F}}_{ij}^{n+1/2} A_{ij}.
\end{equation}
%
In this expression the flux $\mathbf{\hat{F}}^{n+1/2}$ is taken to be a time averaged and
constant across the cell face. To be able to use eq.\ref{eq.flux_update} a strategy must
be taken to estimate $\mathbf{\hat{F}}^{n+1/2}$ which will be described in sec. and $A_{ij}$
that will be described in the section.

\subsection{Tessellation}
As stated in section 2, the Euler equations, as written as 4, assumes that the cells are of the
form of polyhedrons. There are many forms of space partitioning that meet this criteria but for
this paper we will restrict our attention to the Voronoi tessellation. The Voronoi tessellation
partitions the space into a set of disjoint polyhedrons for a given set of points. The set of
points are called mesh generators and for each generator their corresponds a region consisting of
all points that are closer to that generator than any other. Thus, for each mesh generating pair
there lies a polygon that is equidistant. This geometric property will be exploited in section 4.
For the rest of this paper we will refer to the polyhedra associated with the mesh generator as 
a cell and the polygons making up the polyhedra as faces.

The creation of the Voronoi tessellation can be performed by first constructing the Delaunay
triangulation. The Delaunay tessellation is the dual graph of the Voronoi tessellation and is
defined as the triangulation of points such that no point in the set lies inside the 
circum-circle of any of the triangles in 2d. In 3d the triangles become tetrahedron but
the same definition applies. Remaining in 2d for simplicity, the points are the vertices's
of the triangles. The dual aspect refers to the fact that each triangle edge corresponds to
a Voronoi face and each Voronoi vertex corresponds to the center of the circumcirlce of the
triangle.
