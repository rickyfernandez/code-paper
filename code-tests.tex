\section{Tests}
\subsection{Unit Tests}

\subsection{Hydro Tests}
In this section we present a series of tests to help verify the integrity and stability
of the hydrodynamic algorithms used. For each test it is assumed that linear reconstruction,
mesh movement, motion correction, and HLLC algorithm was used unless stated otherwise. We
have found the HLLC, in most cases, to be as accurate as the Exact solver. In doing so, we have 
chosen the HLLC as our default solver as it is more accurate than the HLL and less computational 
intensive then the Exact solver. All scripts to generate the simulations and plots will be found
in the \textbf{test\_suite} directory.

\subsubsection{Linear Wave}
Sound waves provide the mechanism to transport disturbances through a fluid. An
elementary test problem is the ability maintain wave propagation of small
disturbances. Given a fluid in equilibrium with constant density $\rho_0$,
pressure $P_0$ and zero velocity $\mathbf{v}=0$ with perturbations of the form
\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{rcl}
		\rho & = & \rho_0 + \delta\rho(x,t) \\
   		 P & = & P_0 + \delta p(x,t) \\
    	\mathbf{v} & = & \delta\mathbf{v}(x,t),
    \end{array}
\end{equation}
and maintaining terms to first order in the Euler equations produce the wave
equation for each variable with sound speed equal to the fluid's sound speed 
$c_s$. Thus, setting a small disturbance 
will propagate with a finite velocity maintaining its form as along as the initial
disturbances are relatively small.

We set up a 2d box of unit length with constant $\rho_0=1.0$, $P_0=3/5$, $\mathbf{v}=0$,
and $\gamma=5/3$ with periodic boundary conditions. A sinusoidal wave in the $x$ direction of 
the form $\delta\rho(x,t) = A\mathrm{sin}(kx + wt)$ with $k=w=2\pi$ and $A=10^{-6}$ is added at 
time $t=0$. The remaining disturbances can be specified through $\delta\rho$ by the following
\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{rcl}
        \delta \mathbf{v}(x,0) & = & \left(\frac{w}{k}\right)\delta
        	\rho(x,0)/\rho_0\mathbf{\hat{x}}\\
        \delta P(x,0) & = & \left(\frac{w}{k}\right)^2\delta\rho(x,0).
    \end{array}
\end{equation}
The values chosen produce waves traveling rightward with a velocity of 1. The simulation is
evolved for 1 unit of time such that the waves return to its' initial position at time $t=0$. 
Moreover, we study the convergence behavior by comparing the final state of the density to 
the initial density by computing the $L1$ norm,
\begin{equation}
	L1 = \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_i \left| \rho_i - \rho(x_i) \right|,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_i$ is final density at position $x_i$ and $\rho(x_i)$ is the density at t=0
at position $x_i$ and $N$ is the number of cells per dimension. Five simulations where evolved
with varying resolution $N=10, 20, 40, 80, 160$ with the initial particles laid out in a
Cartesian grid.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/linear-wave-l1.eps}
        \caption{L1 norm of linear wave problem in 2d. Blue points are results
        of simulation from different resolutions overlaid by a linear fit showing
        the convergence is approximately second order. This example was produced by
        \textbf{linear\_wave\_2d.py} and \textbf{l1\_norm.py} scripts.}
        \label{fig.linear-wave}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig.linear-wave} shows the $L1$ norm as a function of grid cells per dimension.
As expected, the convergence rate is approximately second order in time and space for
this smooth problem. In the presence of shocks or other discontinuities it is not expected
to have such convergence.

\subsubsection{Sod shock-tube}
To examine the ability of the code to handle shock propagation we perform the Sod shock-tube 
problem \citep{toro-1997}. The problem consists of two different constant states at rest separated 
at the midpoint of the $x$ axis. A discontinuity exist in the density and pressure at that point. 
After $t=0$ the high density region flows into the lower density region. The flow produces a 
rarefaction, contact discontinuity, and a shock wave emanating from the density discontinuity. Thus, 
this problem creates a great test for the codes ability to capture the three wave types.

For our initial setup we use a unit box with reflective boundary conditions with density and pressure defined as
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
        	1.0 & \text{for}\ x \leq 0.5 \\
            0.125 & \text{for}\ x > 0.5
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	P = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
        	1.0 & \text{for}\ x \leq 0.5 \\
            0.1 & \text{for}\ x > 0.5
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
with $\gamma = 1.4$. The particles are laid out in a Cartesian grid and the simulation is evolved
until $t=0.15$. The number of particles per dimension is chosen to be $N=100$ and $N=45$ for 2D
and 3D respectively. This allows a comparison of a high and low resolution run.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/sod_2d.eps}
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/sod_3d.eps}
        \caption{Profiles of density, $x$-component of velocity and pressure of the Sod 
        shock-tube simulation. Left: 2D run using a total of $100\times100$ particles. Right: 3D run 
        using a total of $45\times45\times45$, we only plot a slice of particles defined by $z=0$.
        Light blue points are the simulation while the red line is the exact solution.
        This example was produced by \textbf{sod\_2d\_cartesian.py},
        \textbf{sod\_3d\_cartesian.py}, \textbf{sod\_2d\_profiles.py}, and 
        \textbf{sod\_3d\_profiles.py} scripts.}
        \label{fig.sod}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig.sod} plots the particles density, $x$-component of velocity and pressure; only 
particles with $z=0$ are plotted in the 3D run for simplicity. The red line is the analytical 
solution. For the 2D simulation we can see the shock is well resolved as is the contact 
discontinuity. Further, the Lagrangian nature of the code can be seen as many particles have been 
squeezed between the contact discontinuity and the shock front while particles in the rarefaction 
have been spread out. For the 3D, lower resolution run, the code catches all three waves. Although, 
the contact discontinuity wave has been smoothed due to the lower number of particles.

\subsubsection{Explosion}
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/explosion_2d.eps}
        \caption{Density heatmap and radial profile of the Explosion problem. Left density
        heatmap, the irregular cells can been seen from the random initialization. Right
        radial density profile is an agreement with the exact solution in red.
        This example was produced by \textbf{explosion\_2d\_random.py} and 
        \textbf{explosion\_density\_panel.py} scripts.}
        \label{fig.explosion_2d}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
An analog to the Sod problem is the 2D explosion problem \citep{toro-1997}. Like the Sod problem, 
the domain is partitioned into two constant states. However, the higher density region is now a 
circular region of radius $r$ centered in a unit box. Similar to the Sod problem, the initial 
conditions generate a shock, contact discontinuity and rarefaction wave. However, in this case
the waves are now a circular shock traveling radially outward, a circular contact
discontinuity traveling in the same direction, and a rarefaction wave traveling towards the
center.

We use the same values as the Sod problem except we restrict the higher density values onto
the center of domain with radius $r=0.25$. Further, instead of using a Cartesian grid we sample
particles uniformly for a unit square and perform 10 iterations of Lloyds algorithm. 

Figure \ref{fig.explosion_2d} shows the density map and density profile. Clearly, the cells
density matches the analytical solution in red. Further, the solution captures all three waves
even though the mesh was built in a random fashion. This an important difference over Eulerian
codes, since Lagrangian codes are not constrained to any initial particle placement. Therefore
one can reach better accuracy by placing the particles in way that exploits the problem. We will
see a later example of this in the Evrards problem, see Section \ref{sec.evrards}.

\subsubsection{Gresho vortex}
Our next problem will test stability of the code in maintaining equilibrium. \cite{Gresho90}, 
introduced an interesting problem to test for conservation of angular momentum. A vortex in a unit 
2D box with constant density $\rho=1$ is setup with the following angular velocity
\begin{equation}
	v_\phi (r) = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
        	5r & \text{for}\ 0 \leq r < 0.2 \\
            2-5r & \text{for}\ 0.2 \leq r < 0.4 \\
            0 &\text{for}\ \geq 0.4
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
The angular velocity of the vortex grows linearly as one moves radially outward from
the center until midway of the disk. Then the velocity decreases linearly until it
vanishes at the rim of the disk. This produces triangular shape velocity profile.
The corresponding pressure is
\begin{equation}
	P(r) = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
        	5 + 25/2r^2 & \text{for}\ 0 \leq r < 0.2 \\
            9+25/2r^2 - 20r + 4\ln(r/0.2) & \text{for}\ 0.2 \leq r < 0.4 \\
            3 + 4\ln(2) &\text{for}\ \geq 0.4.
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
The pressure is chosen such that the pressure gradients balance the centrifugal forces
generated by the rotation. Thus producing a solution that is independent of time.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/gresho_vortex.eps}
        \caption{Heatmap and radial profile of azimuthal velocity. Top row: time evolution
        of the cells at times $t=0.0, 0.5, 3.0$. Bottom row: corresponding radial profile of 	
        azimuthal velocity. As the simulation evolves the systems remains in equilibrium.
        This example was produced by \textbf{gresho\_2d\_cartesian.py} and 
        \textbf{gresho\_density\_panel.py} scripts.}
        \label{fig.gresho_vortex}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig.gresho_vortex} shows three snapshots at $t=0.0, 0.5, 3.0$ of the azimuthal
velocity. The top row is a 2d heat map while the bottom row is a radial profile. At time $t=0$
all the cells are rectangular. As the system evolves the cells that are rotating become irregular 
polygons. There is a small amount of velocity smoothing at the initial largest velocities and at
the rim of the vortex. However, it is evident that the system stays in equilibrium.

\subsubsection{Sedov-Taylor}
\label{sec.sedov}
Another test that generates a shock is the Sedov-Taylor blast wave problem \citep{Sedov1959}. In 
this problem a homogeneous gas is injected with a large amount of energy in a point-like region at 
the center of the domain. A spherical shock is created emanating from the center. The shock 
propagates radially outward sweeping mass into a thin shell and creating a cavity behind the shock. 
The problem has a well known analytical self-similar solution; see \cite{Sedov1959} for details. 
Applying the Rankine–Hugoniot at the shock front the density jumps to a maximum compression of
\begin{equation}
	\rho_{\mathrm{max}}/\rho = (\gamma + 1)/(\gamma - 1),
\end{equation}
for $\gamma = 5/3$ this amounts to a max value of 4.

We consider the 2D and 3D case. A unit box is setup with particles in a Cartesian grid of size
$45\times 45$ and $45 \times 45 \times 45$ for 2D and 3D respectively. The stationary gas has
a constant density of $\rho = 1.0$ and pressure $P = 10^{-6}$ with $\gamma=5/3$. The simulation is
allowed to evolve to time $t=0.06$.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/sedov_compare.eps}
        \caption{Density profile of Sedov-Taylor blast wave problem. Left: 2D version with an 
        initially Cartesian mesh of $45 \times 45$. Right: 3D version with an initially 
        Cartesian mesh of $45 \times 45 \times 45$; only a random sample of $45\times45$ is
        plotted for simplicity. Light blue points are the density at radius $r$ 
        from the center of the explosion while the red line is the exact solution.
        This example was produced by \textbf{sedov\_2d\_cartesian.py},
        \textbf{sedov\_3d\_cartesian.py}, and \textbf{sedov\_density\_compare.py} scripts.}
        \label{fig.sedov}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig.sedov} shows the cell density as a function of radial distance from the center of 
the explosion. It is noted that shock is well resolved by the cells as the mesh has deformed in such 
a way that the shock front contains a large amount of cells which is evident in
Figure \ref{fig.sedov_panel}.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/sedov_panel.eps}
        \caption{Evolution of the density at several times. The initial cell with the energy
        imparted remains stationary as the cells around it move radially outward. The cells at
        the shock are compressed allowing for better resolution. This example was produced by 
        \textbf{sedov\_2d\_cartesian.py} and \textbf{sedov\_density\_panel.py} scripts.}
        \label{fig.sedov_panel}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
The center cell, where the energy is deposited, remains stationary while the
cells around it move radially outward. The cells exterior to the shock remain
stationary until they are swept and compressed by the shock.

\subsubsection{Kelvin-Helmholtz instability}
For our last hydrodynamic test we consider the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. This
problem consist of a shear-flow where a single mode is excited by a velocity perturbation.
Specifically, two layers with different densities are initially in pressure equilibrium. 
Each layer flows in the opposing direction and receives a velocity perturbation perpendicular
to the interface. The perturbation grows exponentially and produces structures which
are called KH instabilities. A difficulty of this problem is that
numerical errors, noise, and resolution seed spurious small structure \citep{Lecoanet2016}
making direct comparisons a difficult endeavor. However, we can use this problem to
visually verify the characteristics of the problem are maintained
and leave the exact detail treatment to the next revision of the code.

We follow \cite{Springel2010} and setup a unit periodic box with density
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
            2 & \text{for}\ y < 0.25 \\
            1 & \text{for}\ 0.25 \leq y \leq 0.75\\
            2 & \text{for}\ 0.75 < y,
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
$x$-component of velocity
\begin{equation}
	v_x = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
            -0.5 & \text{for}\ y < 0.25 \\
            0.5 & \text{for}\ 0.25 \leq y \leq 0.75\\
            -0.5 & \text{for}\ 0.75 < y,
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
and $y$-component of velocity
\begin{equation}
	v_y(x, y) = w_0 \mathrm{sin}(4\pi x) \left(\exp\left(-\frac{(y-0.25)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) +
    	\exp\left(-\frac{(y-0.75)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\right)
\end{equation}
where $w_0=0.1$ and $\sigma=0.05/\sqrt{2}$. The pressure is set to $P=2.5$, $\gamma=5/3$
and the simulation is evolved until time $t=2$.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/kelvin.eps}
        \caption{Evolution of the density at several times in the KH problem. We see the common
        traits of KH evolution, KH billows and mixing. This example was produced by 
        \textbf{kelvin\_helmholtz\_2d\_cartesian.py} and 
        \textbf{kelvin\_helmholtz\_density\_panel.py} 
        scripts.}
        \label{fig.kelvin}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig.kelvin} shows the density field for several selected times. Comparing with
Springel, visually we conclude that the results are in close agreement. The formation of the
Kevlin Helmholtz billows and mixing of both fluids at each time are similar.

\subsection{Gravity Tests}
In this section we continue the testing procedure by including tests of gravity. As in this
previous section, tests that include hydrodynamics will incorporate linear reconstruction,
mesh movement, motion correction, and HLLC algorithm unless stated otherwise. Moreover, for
tests that only include gravity the leap frog integrator will be used.
All scripts to generate the simulations and plots will be found in the \textbf{test\_suite} 
directory.

\subsubsection{Two body}
Our first problem, in testing our gravity solver, is a simple two body problem where two particles
interact with each other through their gravitational force. Although, this problem does not really 
test the implementation of the gravity tree, since only two leaves will be constructed and it is 
more likely that the leaves will interact with each other bypassing node 
moments, it does test the gravity kernel and stability of the leap frog integrator.

For this problem an exact solution exists by reducing to a single body \citep{Landau1969}.
Given two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ with positions $\vec{r}_1$ and $\vec{r}_2$ the 
equation of motion for the reduced mass
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{m_1} + \frac{1}{m_2}
\end{equation}
is
\begin{equation}
	\mu\frac{d^2 \vec{r}}{dt^2} = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}\hat{r},
    \label{eq.reduced-force}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{r}$ is the separation vector $\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_2$. Equation \ref{eq.reduced-force} 
can be transformed to polar coordinates giving the solution
\begin{equation}
	r = \frac{a(1-\epsilon^2)}{1-\epsilon \mathrm{cos}(\theta)}
\end{equation}
for initial conditions $a$ and $\epsilon$. The overall system evolves with a period of
\begin{equation}
    T = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G m}},
\end{equation}
where $m=m_1 + m_2$. To recover the particles positions, a final transformation
of the form
\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{rcl}
		\vec{r}_1 & = & \frac{m_1}{m}\vec{r}\\
    	\vec{r}_2 & = & -\frac{m_2}{m}\vec{r}
    \end{array}
\end{equation}
is used. The initial position and velocity of the particles can be parameterized by $a$,
$\epsilon$ and $q=m_1/m_2$
\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{rcl}
    	\vec{r}_1 & = & a\frac{1-\epsilon}{1+q} \hat{x}\\
        \vec{v}_1 & = & \frac{1}{1+q}\sqrt{\frac{1+\epsilon}{1-\epsilon}}\sqrt{\frac{Gm}{a}} \hat{y}\\
        \vec{r}_2 & = & -q \vec{r}_1\\
        \vec{v}_2 & = & -q \vec{v}_1.
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

We setup the particles with parameter values $a=0.5$, $\epsilon=0.25/0.75$ and $G=1$ and allow
the simulation to evolve for 10 periods. The time step is held fixed with a value of $dt=T/1000$.
In Figure \ref{fig.two_body} we show the trajectory for both particles as well as the evolution of
the relative total energy error. We clearly see that both trajectories remain along the exact 
solution, in red, signifying the stability of the leap frog integrator. Further we see that the 
relative total energy error remains bounded by zero and $-1.1\times10^{-4}$ indicating that the 
total energy remains accurately conserved.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/two_body.eps}
        \caption{Left: trajectories of the two body problem for ten periods. Clearly
        both particles remain in their orbital path shown in red signifying the stability
        of the leap frog integrator. Right: corresponding relative total energy error.
        The total energy remains accurately conserved as the worst relative error is
        $-1.1\times10^{4}$. This example was produced by 
        \textbf{two\_body.py} and \textbf{two\_body\_panel.py}}
        \label{fig.two_body}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Plummer sphere}
The Plummer sphere \citep{Plummer1911} is a model that can be used to describe the distribution of 
stars and in a cluster and is commonly used to test gravity solvers. The Plummer sphere, i.e. a 
polytrope of index 5, has a density profile of the from
\begin{equation}
	\rho (r) = \frac{3 M}{4\pi R^3} \left(1 + (r/R)^2\right)^{-5/2},
    \label{eq.plummer}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the total mass and $R$ is a scale parameter which sets the
size of the cluster. The system is in steady state with an isotropic velocity distribution.
To test our gravity solver, we initialize our particles with the given distributions and
advance the system in time. We expect the system to stay in steady state therefore we compare
the initial density distribution with the final state.

For our test we chose the parameters of the Plummer sphere to be $M=1,000$ and $R=1$ with
$G=1$. We then sampled 10,000 particles using the the rejection technique outlined in
\cite{Aarseth1974} to set the position and velocities. The system is allowed to evolve to time 
$t=1$, which is roughly ten dynamical times, and a fixed time step of $dt=0.001$. The
gravitational tree parameters used was an opening angle 0.4 and smoothing parameter of 0.03.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/plummer.eps}
        \caption{Density profile and relative total energy error evolution. Left: the initial and 
        final density distribution overlaid by the Plummer density profile. The markers are shell
        density averages divided by the shell density. At the the end of the evolution the 
        particles remain in a Plummer distribution. Right: evolution of the  relative total energy 
        error. The error remains relatively small indicating the total energy remains accurately
        conserved. This example was produced by \textbf{plummer.py} and 
        \textbf{plummer\_panel.py}.}
        \label{fig.plummer}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
The left panel of Figure \ref{fig.plummer} shows the density profile at the initial and final 
time of the simulation with equation \ref{eq.plummer} overlaid as a reference. The density is 
calculated by dividing the space by spherical shells, binning and dividing by the volume. It is 
clearly shown at the final time that the particles remain in steady state with their positions 
matching the initial distribution. The right panel of \ref{fig.plummer} shows the evolution of the 
relative error of the total energy of the system. The error stays well below $5\times 10^{-4}$ with 
a final error of $2\times 10^{-4}$, entailing the solver has accurately maintained conservation
of total energy.

\subsubsection{Rayleigh-Taylor instability}
Our first hydrodynamic problem which includes gravity is the Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem.
The problem consists of a dense fluid resting over a lighter fluid in the presence of an uniform 
vertical gravitational field. A velocity perturbation is placed in the vertical direction causing 
the dense field to sink while the lighter rises through buoyancy.

A rectangular Cartesian domain is chosen as $x \in [0, 1]$ and $y \in [0,3]$ of size $50\times150$ 
with reflective boundary conditions. Typically this problem is performed with periodic in the 
$x$-direction with reflective in the $y$-direction. However, we currently don't have an 
implementation of mixed boundary conditions. Nonetheless, the reflective boundary in the 
$x$-direction will not affect our single mode until later times of our analysis. The gravitational 
force is placed in the $y$-direction and has strength of $g=1$. The initial density is
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
            1 & \text{for}\ y \leq 1.5 \\
            2 & \text{for}\ y > 1.5,
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
while the pressure is
\begin{equation}
	P = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
            10 - y & \text{for}\ y \leq 1.5 \\
            11.5 + 2(y-1.5) & \text{for}\ y > 1.5.
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
The system, initially in hydrostatic equilibrium, is given a velocity perturbation
in the $y$-direction
\begin{equation}
	v_y = \mathrm{cos}\left(2\pi x\right)\exp\left(-(y-1.5)^2/0.1^2\right).
\end{equation}
We set $\gamma=1$ and let the system evolve to a time $t=3.0$. Although without an implementation
of viscosity there is no one correct solution that all codes converge to \citep{Stone2008}.
However, we can visually inspect our solution for common traits of this problem. Two simulations
where performed, first constraining the mesh to be stationary and second allowing the mesh to move.
\begin{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig.rayleigh} we see both simulations have the expected results, the lighter fluid
rising around the denser fluid that sinks and both developing billows. For the stationary case,
the simulation maintains vertical symmetry. Unlike the moving mesh counterpart that loses
symmetry at the final output time. This is expected, as pointed out by \cite{Springel2010} since the 
mesh correction motion (steer the cells to become rounder) can trigger perturbations of their own.
The symmetry can be maintained for longer times by increasing the resolution but ultimately 
both simulation lose their symmetry by round off noise since the system is chaotic.

\subsubsection{Evrard Collapse}
\label{sec.evrards}
The final test is the Evrards collapse problem \citep{Evrard1988} which tests the coupling of
self-gravity and hydrodynamics. The problem consists of an initially non-rotating isothermal gas 
sphere with mass $M=1$ and radius $R=1$ with density 
\begin{equation}
	\rho(r) = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
            1/\left(2\pi r\right) & \text{for}\ r \leq 1 \\
            0 & \text{for}\ r > 1
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
and pressure
\begin{equation}
	P(r) = \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
            0.05 /\left(3\pi r\right) & \text{for}\ r \leq 1 \\
            0 & \text{for}\ r > 1.
    	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
The evolution of the sphere begins with mass falling towards the center due to self-gravity. The 
pressure at the center rises and produces a shock traveling outward through the in-falling gas. The 
final state of the gas is a spherical distribution in hydrostatic virial equilibrium.

We setup an initial Cartesian grid of range $[0,2.5]^3$ with $33\times33\times33$ particles.
The gas sphere is centered at $(1.25, 1.25, 1.25)$. Due to the nature of the $1/r$ density profile,
a Cartesian mesh will not resolve the high density values unless the resolution is sufficiently 
increased. However we have complete freedom on how to place the initial particles. Therefore, we 
transform particles radially inside the sphere by the following
\begin{equation}
    r_{\mathrm{new}} = r_{\mathrm{old}}^{3/2}.
\end{equation}
Such a transformation maps a grid of equally spaced particles with uniform density to
a set of particles spaced in a way that the uniform density follows a $1/r$ profile.
Performing this transformation produces particles with equal mass and $1/r$ density profile.

        \caption{Profiles of the density, radial velocity and entropy at $t=0.81$ overlaid

        \textbf{evrard\_profiles.py}.}

\end{figure}

The radial averaged density, velocity and entropy are shown in Figure \ref{fig.evrard} at time 
$t=0.81$ with a high resolution 1D solution for reference. At this time the shock is fully formed 
and is traveling outward. We see that each profile adequately follows the exact solution in red for 
this low resolution run. Further we see significant error in the conservation of total energy 
Figure \ref{fig.evrard_energy}; a relative error of $27\%$ at the final state. This is expected as 
it is pointed out by \cite{Springel2010}. The discrepancy arises from the gravitational work term 
which ignores the motion of mass exchanged by adjacent cells. \cite{Springel2010} proposed a new 
formulation for then energy equation that results in better total energy conservation. This updated 
method will be added in the next revision of the code.
